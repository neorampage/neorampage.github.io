> Let's start with our nmap scan.

```
nmap -sV 10.10.55.215
```

![nmap](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/nmap.png)

> I found that the machine has web service on port 80, so I can use my web browser to try to get something.

![browser](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/browser.png)

> Nothing special!
>
> Mmmmm... If I try to get **robots.txt**?*

![robots](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/robots.png)

> Bad luck!!, the website doesn't have it.
>
> Now I'm going to try with **gobuster** and maybe I can get some directories

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.55.215/
```

![gobuster1](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/gobuster1.png)

> Great! I found **/island**
>
> I use this in my web browser again.

![island1](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/island1.png)

> I can see the text is not complete, so I'm going to try to see the source code.
>
> **¡¡¡Bingo!!!**

![island2](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/island2.png)

> And now what?
> Is a good idea if I run gobuster again but this time in **/Island** directory

![gobuster2](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/gobuster2.png)

> Perfect!! I found **/2100** directory.
> I'm check the new directory in the browser.

![2100](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/2100.png)

> I watched the video and It was not helpful, maybe I need to see the source code again.
>
> Okay!!! I got something interesting.

![ticket](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/ticket.png)

> I spent many hours thinking what can I do here?, so after a few hours I thought that **.ticket** could be an extension, but where could it be used? I'll use this right here at **/2100**, following the advice I found in he source code.
>
> So let's try gobuster again

```
gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.55.215/island/2100 -x .ticket
```

![gobuster3](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/gobuster3.png)

> I found **green_arrow.ticket** and if I try to open the I find this.

![green_arrow.png](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/green_arrow.png)

> I think the text is encrypt. Cipher are not a easy subject for me, so It will take me some time to get the correct way to decrypt the cipher.
> After some hours I found the correct way to decrypt the cipher using **base58** 

![base58](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/base58.png)

> Okay! Let's try to login using **FTP** with the credentials that I found 

![ftp](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/ftp.png)

> Great!!! I'm in!!

> I'm going to use **ls** for list all files and directories.

![ls](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/ls.png)

> Downloading the images

![download](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/download.png)

> Maybe the machine has other users, so It is a good idea to check home directory.

![home](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/home.png)

> If I verify the images headers with exiftool I got this error in one of the three images

![leave](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/leave.png)

> I'm goingt to fix the image usign **hexedit** but first I need the PNG **Hex Gradient**

![hex1](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/hex1.png)

> Now I can fix the PNG image.

![hex1](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/hex2.png)

> Using ** steghide ** for Verify if the images have embed information

![teg2](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/steg1.png)

> Extracting the **zip** from **aa.jpg**
>
> From the zip file I got the files **passwd.txt** and **shado** 

![zip](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/zip.png)

> I think that I have the corrects shh credentias.
>
> I log in with with the ssh credentials and I run ls command to try to get  **user.txt**

![user](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/user.png)

> I got it!!!
>
> So now I'm going to verify if i can run sudo command.
>
> This is interesting, I can run  **pkexec** with sudo. 

![pkexec](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/pkexec.png)

```
sudo pkexec --user root /bin/bash
```

> Perfect!! I found root.txt

![root](/assets/media/thm/Lian_Yu/root.png)

> Happy Hacking!!!
